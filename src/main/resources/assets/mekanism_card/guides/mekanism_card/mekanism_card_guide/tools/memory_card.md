# Memory Card

<ItemImage id="mekanism_card:memory_card" />

The Memory Card copies and pastes machine configurations between Mekanism machines. It stores configuration and upgrades from one machine and applies them to others.

<RecipeFor id="mekanism_card:memory_card" />

## Copying

To copy configuration:

- Sneak + right-click a machine: copy config and upgrades to the card.

The tooltip shows the source machine type.

## Pasting

To paste configuration:

- Right-click a machine: apply stored config to the target machine. This consumes upgrade cards if needed.

The target must be the same machine type, and your inventory or bound AE2/QIO network must contain enough upgrade cards.

## Batch Pasting

- Hold the selection key (Left Ctrl by default) and left-click two corners: paste to matching machines in that cuboid.
- Hold the FTB Ultimine key while right-clicking: paste to matching machines in its current selection.

Normal right-click only pastes to the clicked machine.

## Network Storage

The Memory Card can pull missing upgrade cards from a bound AE2 network or QIO frequency when pasting upgrades.

- AE2: link the item in a Wireless Access Point.
- QIO: sneak + right-click a QIO block with a selected frequency.
- Consumption priority: inventory, AE2, then QIO.

## Clearing

To clear stored configuration:

- Sneak + right-click air: clear the stored config.

This resets the card so you can copy a new machine.
